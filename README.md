Some Alfred workflows I created

The GoogleCalendar workflow makes working with Google Calendar easier.

It lets you open Google Calendar in the browser with both a keyword and a keyboard hotkey.

It also lets you quickly add events to Google Calendar.
The format for adding an event is:

gc [event] at [time] on [date] in [location]

It's pretty simple but does the job.
